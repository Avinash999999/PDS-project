# Housing Prices Prediction

This project predicts housing prices based on various features such as location, size, and other property characteristics. It uses machine learning techniques to create an accurate and reliable model.

## Description

The goal of this project is to:
- Help homeowners, buyers, and real estate agents estimate property values.
- Demonstrate the application of machine learning in real-world scenarios.

The dataset used contains information on houses, such as square footage, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, and neighborhood details.

## Features
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover trends in housing data.
- Data preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling numerical data.
- Model training using algorithms like Linear Regression and Random Forest.
- Evaluation of model performance with metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared.
